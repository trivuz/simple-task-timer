        <h2>About Task Timer</h2>
        <p>Task Timer is an HTML5/JavaScript project I (Schuyler Cebulskie) created in order to fulfill my needs in keeping track of the time that I spent working for a company that I was an intern at. It has quickly become something with a wider range of uses, and has gained features very quickly in the past months. I began this project in August (or maybe September), and have continuously been working on it since. It started out as a boring old thing with absolutely no styles to it at all. I added styles a few days after the first release. After adding a link to make a suggestion for me, the most popular suggestion was to offer finer granularity in your goal time - it used to only be in hours. Since then, it's evolved into the version you're looking at.</p>
        <p>Task Timer is an open source project. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simple-task-timer/" target="_blank">Check it out on Google Code!</a></p>
        
        <h2 id="me">About me (Schuyler Cebulskie)</h2>
        <p>My usual alias is Gawdl3y. I'm an 11th grade student in high school, and my favourite areas of study are the computer sciences. I've dumped a fair amount of time into many different coding languages, but I primarily work with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I just finished a C++ class in school, and I have done two years of Visual Basic 6.0. I enjoy working on projects such as these in my free time (I have loads of it).</p>
        <p>I enjoy playing computer and video games. I own a PS3, but it just died recently. I plan on getting a new one very soon. You can add me to your friends list with the username SneakymodeEngage. I also enjoy playing games on the computer (modding!). You can add me on Steam via <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gawdl3y" target="_blank">my Steam profile</a>. I'm currently playing mostly Skyrim, Team Fortress 2, Minecraft, Terraria, and Dungeon Defenders on the computer, and LittleBigPlanet 2 and Battlefield 3 on the PS3. I just built a new computer, but I still need to get a video card. The Sandy Bridge's integrated Intel HD 3000 graphics are holding me over just fine, though.</p>
        <p>I have a website! <a href="http://gawdl3y.com/" target="_blank">Gawdl3y.com</a> There's not much on it currently, though. I am an administrator of the gaming community and Minecraft server <a href="http://titankingdoms.com/" target="_blank">Titan Kingdoms</a>.</p>

            <p>This update may cause some oddities with your current tasks, due to the the format change. New tasks you make will not have any problems, but the old ones might. I have attempted to have the old format convert to the new format as accurately as possible, but there may be some problems.
